    Note that raw moments are neither translation, scale nor rotation
    invariant.
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : nD double or uint8 array
        Rasterized shape as image.
    scales : array
        Scales with the same size as ndim of the input image.
    order : int, optional
        Maximum order of moments. Default is 3.
