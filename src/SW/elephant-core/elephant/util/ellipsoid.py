def ellipsoid(center, radii, rotation, scales=None, shape=None, minarea=0):
    """Generate coordinates of pixels within ellipsoid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    center : (3,) ndarray of double
        Centre coordinate of ellipsoid.
    radii : (3,) ndarray of double
        Radii of ellipsoid
    rotation : (3, 3) ndarray of double
        Rotation matrix of ellipsoid.
    scales : (3,) array-like of double
        Scales of axes w.r.t. center and radii.
    shape : tuple, optional
        Image shape which is used to determine the maximum extent of output
        pixel coordinates. This is useful for ellipsoids which exceed the
        image size.
        By default the full extent of the ellipsoid is used.
    minarea : int
        Minumum area to be drawn.
        Ellipsoid will be enlarged inside the calculated bounding box until it
        reaches to this value.
        This parameter is useful when the user wants to force to draw
        ellipsoids even when the calculated area is small.

    Returns
    -------
    dd, rr, cc : ndarray of int
        Voxel coordinates of ellipsoid.
        May be used to directl index into an array, e.g.
        ``img[dd, rr, cc] = 1``
